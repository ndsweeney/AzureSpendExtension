How to use the extension

1. Setup a user that has the correct permissions
2. Register an app and give it the correct permissions
3. Download the Azure Spend extension
4. Update the code to contain your app ID and subscription ID
  Specifically AppID: auth.js:3 - manifest.json:18 and SubscriptionID- popup.js:10 && line:206
5. Enable Developer mode in Edge
6. Use it

I will be updating this as time goes on over the winter once I have some feedback about what people would like to see.
